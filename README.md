# Quote Search App

This is a simple project I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It fetches quotes from an online API and lets you search through them by typing in the search box. Only quotes that contain the text you type will be shown.

## Features

- Gets quotes from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/quotes)
- Filters quotes based on what you type
- Shows an error message if the API doesn't work

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Wait for the quotes to load.
3. Start typing in the search input to filter the quotes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

## Why I Made This

This project is part of my application for the **Code2Career** training program by Gaza Sky Geeks.
